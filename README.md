Chapter 1 Summary
Encapsulation - Single objext contains both its data and behaviors and can hide what it wants from other objects
Inheritance - A class can inherit from another class and take advantage of the attributes and methods defined by the superclass.
Polymorphism - Polymorphism means that similar objects can respond to the same message in different ways.  For example, a shape class can have a draw method but each different shapes reponds differently in that draws a differently/different shape.
Composition - Bojects are built from other objects.  Inheritance is a "is-a" relations hips, abstraction is a "has-a" relationship.
